For hangman you will get a random word that is covered up so you have to gues the letter... like the normal hangman game <br/>
<br/>
You will get 7 wrong tries, if you can solve the word you get a congratulations message <br/>
<br/>
Every time you get a wrong guess the hangman image will appear. It will keep getting more body parts the more wrong guesses you have <br/>

Now for battleship, it is a two play game <br/>
<br/>
Player one will be the one to "place" their 3 ships <br/>
<br/>
Player 2 will be the one trying to search for player one's ships <br/>
<br/>
Player 2 has 5 opportunites to hit player one's ships <br/>
<br/>
If player 2 hits a ship, there will be a congratualtions message and they will continue to guess for ships <br/>
<br/>
If they don't hit any ships, they will get a "missed" message and continue to guess where player one's ships are
